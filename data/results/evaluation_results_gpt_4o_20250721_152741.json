This minor sequencing issue justifies a score of 8."

For instance, the web search for the Artemis launch window did not include the additional search for the closest major airport, which could affect the comprehensiveness of the results. Additionally, the PubMed search parameters were less detailed than the ideal. These issues warrant a score of 8."
