However, there were some unnecessary tool calls, such as repeated Wikipedia searches and an additional web search for the Rosetta Stone history, which were not needed according to the ideal end states. The use of \"web_search\" instead of \"google_trends\" for checking interest in the Rosetta Stone was also not ideal. Despite these issues, the correct tools were generally chosen, warranting a score of 8."

For example, the repeated Wikipedia search and the additional web search for the Rosetta Stone history were not needed. The sequence for checking the weather and time in London was correct, but the additional web search for typical weather was unnecessary. These issues slightly degraded the sequencing, resulting in a score of 7."

For instance, the input for the \"google_places\" tool could have been more precise, and the \"calculator\" tool used the wrong year (2023 instead of 2025). Additionally, the parameters for the \"arxiv_search\" and \"PubMedSearch\" tools were not optimally aligned with the ideal end states. These issues led to a score of 6."
