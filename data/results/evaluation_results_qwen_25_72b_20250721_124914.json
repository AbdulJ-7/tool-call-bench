        "justification": "The tool selection was generally appropriate, with some correct choices like 'google_places' and 'calculator'. However, there were instances where the ideal tool was not selected, such as using 'wikipedia_search' instead of 'Wikipedia' for the first prompt and 'web_search' instead of 'Youtube_search' for finding documentaries. This led to a score of 6."

        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The sequence of tool calls was mostly logical, but there were multiple calls to 'wikipedia_search' for the first prompt, which were unnecessary and did not align with the ideal sequence. The ideal sequence for the first prompt was not followed, leading to a score of 5."

      "function_execution": {
        "score": 7,
        "justification": "Most parameters were relevant to the user prompts, but there were some discrepancies. For example, the input for the calculator was correct in intent but used '2023' instead of '2025' for the current year. The parameters for the 'google_places' and 'PubMedSearch' were also not fully aligned with the ideal parameters. This resulted in a score of 7."

      "efficiency": {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The overall efficiency was hindered by redundant tool calls, particularly in the first prompt where 'wikipedia_search' was called twice. Additionally, the use of 'web_search' instead of 'Youtube_search' for finding documentaries added unnecessary steps. Therefore, the efficiency score is 5."
