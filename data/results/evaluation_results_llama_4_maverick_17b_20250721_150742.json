However, in subsequent prompts, there are instances of using multiple tools when a single tool would suffice, such as in the second and third prompts. This leads to a lower score as the tool choices do not consistently align with the ideal."

For example, in the second prompt, the sequence of web searches is not necessary and does not follow the ideal sequence. The third prompt also has a poor sequence with multiple web searches that do not contribute to summarizing a specific video. This lack of adherence to the ideal sequence results in a lower score."

In the final prompt, the email content is overly complex and does not align with the ideal summary request. This inconsistency leads to a mid-range score."
