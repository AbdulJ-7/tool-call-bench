        "score": 7,
        "justification": "The tool selections were mostly appropriate, with the agent using equivalent tools for the tasks. However, in the second prompt, the agent used a \"weather\" tool instead of the ideal \"Weather\" tool, which is a minor deviation. The other tool choices were either ideal or equivalent, justifying a score of 7 for reasonable alternatives."

        "justification": "The sequencing of tool calls was generally correct, with the agent following a logical order in most cases. However, there were minor issues, such as the second prompt where the weather tool was called before the current time tool, which could have been better sequenced. Despite these minor issues, the overall sequence was effective, leading to a score of 8."

        "score": 9,
        "justification": "The parameters used in the tool calls were mostly accurate and aligned with the intended goals. The only minor issue was in the phrasing of the input for the calculator tool, where the ideal input was \"2025-1799\" instead of \"2025 - 1799\". This slight difference does not significantly impact the execution, resulting in a high score of 9."

However, there were some unnecessary steps, such as the lack of a summarization tool for the videos in the second prompt, which could have streamlined the process. This leads to a score of 7 for efficiency."
