The use of \"wikipedia_search\" and \"youtube_search\" for the first prompt aligns well with the ideal tools \"Wikipedia\" and \"Youtube_search.\" The \"weather\" and \"current_time\" tools were correctly selected for the weather and time inquiry. The \"google_trends\" and \"calculator\" tools were also appropriately chosen. The only minor issue was the absence of a \"Youtube_Summarizer\" tool call for summarizing a video, which was not present in the logged trajectory. However, this was due to a missing user prompt in the logged trajectory rather than a tool selection error."

The parameters for \"wikipedia_search,\" \"youtube_search,\" \"weather,\" \"current_time,\" \"google_trends,\" \"calculator,\" and \"PubMedSearch\" were appropriate and effective.
