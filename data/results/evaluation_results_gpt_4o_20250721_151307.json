        "justification": "The tool selection was generally appropriate, with most tools being suitable for the tasks at hand. However, there were notable discrepancies, such as using \"google_trends\" instead of \"trends\" and less detailed parameters in some cases. This led to a score of 6, as the tools were functional but not ideal."

        "justification": "The sequencing of tool calls was mostly logical, but there were instances where the ideal sequence included additional calls that were not made in the logged trajectory. This lack of completeness in the sequence led to a score of 5, indicating that while the sequence was generally correct, it was not fully aligned with the ideal."

However, some parameters lacked the detail found in the ideal calls, which affected the overall effectiveness. The calculator function was executed correctly, but other tool calls could have been more precise, resulting in a score of 7."

This led to a score of 6, indicating that while the task was completed, there was room for improvement in terms of minimizing steps."
