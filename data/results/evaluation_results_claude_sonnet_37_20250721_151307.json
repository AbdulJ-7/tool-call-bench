        "justification": "The tool selections were generally appropriate, with most tools being suitable for the tasks at hand. However, there were instances where the ideal tools were not used, such as using \"google_trends\" instead of \"trends\" and \"web_search\" for the flight search instead of the ideal sequence of tools. This led to a deduction from a perfect score."

        "justification": "The sequencing of tool calls was mostly logical, but there were some issues. For example, in the third prompt, the ideal sequence called for a trends search first, followed by a web search for news, but the logged sequence did not follow this order. Additionally, the flight search prompt did not follow the ideal sequence of first determining the launch window. These sequencing issues resulted in a score of 6."

The flight search prompt also included a web search that was not necessary given the context. This led to a score of 6 for efficiency."
