        "score": 6,
        "justification": "The tool selection was generally appropriate, but there were several suboptimal choices. The agent used \"wikipedia_search\" and \"web_search\" when the ideal tool was \"Youtube_search\" for finding documentaries. Additionally, the use of \"weather\" instead of \"Weather\" and \"PubMedSearch\" instead of \"PubMed\" in the last prompt were not ideal. Therefore, a score of 6 reflects that while the tools were mostly relevant, they were not the best choices."

        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The sequencing of tool calls had some issues, particularly in the first prompt where \"wikipedia_search\" was called twice unnecessarily. This redundancy detracted from the ideal sequence. However, the overall order of tool calls was mostly logical, which is why a score of 5 is appropriate, indicating that there were significant issues but not a complete failure in sequencing."

The correct calculation should have been \"2023 - 1799,\" but the agent used \"2025 - 1799.\" This error affects the accuracy of the function execution, leading to a score of 5, indicating that while the parameters were generally appropriate, there were notable mistakes."

        "justification": "The efficiency of the task completion was hindered by unnecessary tool calls and repetitions, particularly in the first prompt where \"wikipedia_search\" was called twice. This redundancy, along with the use of multiple tools when fewer would suffice, resulted in a less efficient process. Therefore, a score of 4 reflects that the task was completed but with significant inefficiencies."
