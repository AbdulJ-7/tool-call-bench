        "justification": "The tool selection was mostly appropriate, with the correct tools chosen for most tasks. The use of \"web_search\" and \"youtube_search\" was correct and equivalent to the ideal tools. However, for the third prompt, \"google_trends\" was used instead of \"trends,\" which is equivalent, but the second ideal tool call was missing. For the fourth prompt, \"PubMedSearch\" was used, which is equivalent to \"PubMed_search.\" The fifth prompt used \"web_search\" correctly, but the subsequent ideal tool calls were missing. The sixth prompt used \"google_places\" correctly, but it was split into two calls instead of one. Overall, the tool selection was mostly correct, with minor deviations."

However, in the third prompt, the second ideal tool call was missing, affecting the sequence. In the fifth prompt, the sequence was incomplete as only the first tool call was made. The sixth prompt had two separate calls instead of one combined call, which slightly affected the sequence. Overall, the sequence was mostly correct, with some minor issues."

For example, in the first prompt, the parameters were slightly different but still captured the intent. In the third prompt, the parameters for \"google_trends\" were not as comprehensive as the ideal. The fourth prompt had a parameter encoding issue, but the intent was clear. The fifth prompt was incomplete, missing parameters for subsequent tool calls. The sixth prompt split the parameters into two calls instead of one. Overall, the parameters were functional but not always optimal."

The fifth prompt was incomplete, affecting efficiency. The sixth prompt had two separate calls instead of one, which was slightly less efficient. Overall, the task was completed with some unnecessary steps and missing actions, affecting efficiency."
