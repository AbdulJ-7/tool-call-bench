Possible mechanisms include particulate irritation, inflammation from toxic insult, or legitimate adaptive immune-mediated response. Although sterile non-protein matter would not be expected to be immunogenic, one Apollo flight surgeon reported increasing symptoms upon repeated perceived exposure with associated eosinophilia, suggestive of possible allergic reactions. Many International Space Station (ISS) crews display a pattern of persistent immune system dysregulation and latent virus reactivation. Some ISS crews manifest atypical respiratory and/or dermatitis symptoms which could have an allergic component. It is logical to anticipate crew immune dysregulation could worsen during prolonged deep space missions and planetary surface hazards will only complicate crew health risks. Allergic (i.e. mast cell-mediated) reactivity could adversely increase negative clinical and operational impacts for long-duration lunar astronauts and affect countermeasure requirements for surface vehicles. This study investigated whether lunar dust exposure could possibly elicit an IgE mediated allergic response during spaceflight by utilizing in vitro cell culture models. Our laboratory was officially approved for receipt of actual lunar dust samples from the Apollo 16 mission from NASA. These samples were used to complete the proposed set of in vitro cell culture experiments, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy individuals, and basophils and eosinophil cell lines. Cells were co-cultured with cellular mitogens, common recall antigens (Der p1), fine ground silica qua",

Both have deleterious effects on the human body. On one hand, weightlessness is known to induce a weakening of the immune system, delayed wound healing and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor deconditioning. On the other hand, radiation exposure can lead to long-term health effects such as cancer and cataracts as well as have an adverse effect on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Ionizing radiation originates from three main sources in space: galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle events and solar winds. Furthermore, inside the spacecraft and inside certain space habitats on Lunar and Martian surfaces, the crew is exposed to intravehicular radiation, which arises from nuclear reactions between space radiation and matter. Besides the approaches already in use, such as radiation shielding materials (such as aluminium, water or polyethylene), alternative shielding materials (including boron nanotubes, complex hybrids, composite hybrid materials, and regolith) and active shielding (using fields to deflect radiation particles) are being investigated for their abilities to mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation. From a biological point of view, it can be predicted that exposure to ionizing radiation during missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will affect the human body in undesirable ways, e.g., increasing the risks of cataracts, cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases, carcinogenesis, as well as accelerated ageing. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the risks related to deep space exploration and to develop mitigation strategies to reduce these risks to a tolerable level. By using biomarkers for radia",

The key findings are as follows: (1) Compared with an individual SiNP, the translocation times for 4 and 6 nm ellipsoidal P-SiNPs decrease by 25-50% and 7.7-30.7% respectively, while those for 4 and 6 nm cubic P-SiNPs increase by 428.6% and 44.4% respectively, due to cooperative effects. (2) As initial minimum distance increases, the crossing times for ellipsoidal P-SiNPs first decrease and then increase, while embedding times for cubic P-SiNPs first increase and then decrease, due to different local curvature. (3) In the combinations of ellipsoidal-coupled cubic P-SiNPs, the translocation times for the 4 nm combination decrease by 25% and 14.3% respectively, while those for the 6 nm combination increase by 30.8% and 88.9%, respectively. (4) As the number of bulges on P-SiNPs increases, the average crossing times for 4 and 6 nm ellipsoidal-type P-SiNPs increase by 40%, 20%, as well as 14.3% and 219.1% respectively, while the embedding times for 4 nm cubic-type P-SiNPs decrease by 60.8% and 68.9% respectively, and those for 6 nm cubic-type P-SiNPs increase by 80.8% and 46.2%, respectively. In conclusion, due to the differences in contact area and local curvature, the translocation characteristics of ellipsoidal and cubic P-SiNPs exhibit two opposite trends under varying situations.\n\nPublished: 2025-05-08\nTitle: Hazards of lunar surface exploration: determining the immunogenicity/allerge",

The Author(s).\nSummary::\nThe advancement in extraterrestrial exploration has highlighted the crucial need for studying how the human cardiovascular system adapts to space conditions. Human development occurs under the influence of gravity, shielded from space radiation by Earth's magnetic field, and within an environment characterized by 24-hour day-night cycles resulting from Earth's rotation, thus deviating from these conditions necessitates adaptive responses for survival. With upcoming manned lunar and Martian missions approaching rapidly, it is essential to understand the impact of various stressors induced by outer-space environments on cardiovascular health. This comprehensive review integrates insights from both actual space missions and simulated experiments on Earth, to analyze how microgravity, space radiation, and disrupted circadian affect cardiovascular well-being. Prolonged exposure to microgravity induces myocardial atrophy and endothelial dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by space radiation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress emerge as key underlying mechanisms along with disturbances in ion channel perturbations, cytoskeletal damage, and myofibril changes. Disruptions in circadian rhythms caused by factors such as microgravity, light exposure, and irregular work schedules, could further exacerbate cardiovascular issues. However, current research tends to predominantly focus on disruptions in the core clock gene, overlooking the multifactorial nature of circadian rhythm disturbances in space. Future space missions should prioritize targeted prevention strategies and early detection methods for identifying cardiovascular risks, to preserve astronaut health and ensure mission success.",

However, The Kennedy Space Center is a NASA facility and is probably best known for launching the Apollo and Space Shuttle missions while The Cape Canaveral Space Force Station is run by the U.S. Department of Defense and was the site of many early missions in the Space Race, including the first human spaceflight by an American, Alan Shepard ... In 1961, NASA began purchasing land on Merritt Island near existing Cape Canaveral launch pads. The Launch Operations Center opened in 1962. President Lyndon Johnson renamed the center to John F.
