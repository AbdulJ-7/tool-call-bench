          "tool_output": "\"Page: Rosetta Stone\\nSummary: The Rosetta Stone is a stele of granodiorite inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences across the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.\\nThe stone was carved during the Hellenistic period and is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at Sais. It was probably moved in late antiquity or during the Mamluk period, and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was found there in July 1799 by French officer Pierre-Fran\\u00e7ois Bouchard during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic script. Lithographic copies and plaster casts soon began circulating among European museums and scholars. When the British defeated the French, they took the stone to London under the terms of the Capitulation of Alexandria in 1801. Since 1802, it has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously and it is the most visited object there.\\nStudy of the decree was already underway when the first complete translation of the Greek text was published in 1803. Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Champollion announced the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the Demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the Demotic (1814); and that phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (1822\\u20131824).\\nThree other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, c. 218 BC. Though the Rosetta Stone is now known to not be unique, it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term \\\"Rosetta Stone\\\" is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.\\n\\nPage: Rosetta Stone (software)\\nSummary: Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc, part of the IXL Learning family of products. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion.\\nThe software's name and logo allude to the ancient stone slab of the same name on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.\\nIXL Learning acquired Rosetta Stone in March 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone\\nSummary: Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone is a side-scrolling beat 'em up arcade video game produced by Techn\\u014ds Japan in 1990. It is the third arcade game in the Double Dragon series. Unlike its predecessors, Double Dragon 3 was not developed internally at Techn\\u014ds, but was contracted to the company East Technology, resulting in a game that looks and plays differently.\\nAs in the previous games of the series, players control twin martial artists Billy and Jimmy Lee, as they are approached by a mysterious fortune teller named Hiruko, who sends them on a worldwide journey to retrieve three mystical Ro\"",

It is the background information that allows people to make informed decisions. Most of the time, the view of a person on a subject will be made in response to the presented context.

Balancing content and context is crucial for effective communication. While content provides the substance of your message, context shapes its meaning and ... The context of a piece of writing is defined as the environment in which it was written, including historical and cultural factors. Understanding context enhances the interpretation of the author's ideas and the text as a whole. It is important to distinguish context from other elements like language and central ideas. Context refers to the historical, cultural, social, and environmental circumstances in which a literary work was created. It encompasses the author's purpose, audience, and the events that occurred during the time period in which the work was written. Understanding context is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the text and its meaning. Imagine hearing someone say, \"That's cool.\" Without context, you might think they're talking about the temperature. But if they're looking at a new gadget, they likely mean it's impressive. Context here clarifies which meaning of \"cool\" is intended, turning a simple word into an accurate message. 2. Historical Context in Literature",

The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences across the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.\\nThe stone was carved during the Hellenistic period and is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at Sais. It was probably moved in late antiquity or during the Mamluk period, and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was found there in July 1799 by French officer Pierre-Fran\\u00e7ois Bouchard during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic script. Lithographic copies and plaster casts soon began circulating among European museums and scholars. When the British defeated the French, they took the stone to London under the terms of the Capitulation of Alexandria in 1801. Since 1802, it has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously and it is the most visited object there.\\nStudy of the decree was already underway when the first complete translation of the Greek text was published in 1803. Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Champollion announced the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); that the Demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the Demotic (1814); and that phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (1822\\u20131824).\\nThree other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, c. 218 BC. Though the Rosetta Stone is now known to not be unique, it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term \\\"Rosetta Stone\\\" is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.\\n\\nPage: Rosetta Stone decree\\nSummary: The Rosetta Stone decree, or the Decree of Memphis, is a Ptolemaic decree most notable for its bilingual and tri-scriptual nature, which enabled the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Issued by a council of priests confirming the royal cult of Ptolemy V in 196 BC at Memphis, it was written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian Demotic and Ancient Greek. It mentions the Egyptian rebellion against the Greek rulers, otherwise known only through Greek sources and remains of graffiti.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Rosetta\\nSummary: Rosetta ( roh-ZET-\\u0259) or Rashid (Arabic: \\u0631\\u0634\\u064a\\u062f, romanized: Ra\\u0161\\u012bd, IPA: [\\u027e\\u0251\\u02c8\\u0283i\\u02d0d]; Coptic: \\u03ef\\u2ca3\\u2c81\\u03e3\\u2c93\\u2ca7, romanized: ti-Rashit) is a port city of the Nile Delta, 65 km (40 mi) east of Alexandria, in Egypt's Beheira governorate. The Rosetta Stone was discovered there in 1799.\\nFounded around the 9th century on the site of the ancient town of Bolbitine, Rosetta boomed with the decline of Alexandria following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, only to wane in importance after Alexandria's revival. During the 19th century, it was a popular British tourist destination, known for its Ottoman mansions, citrus groves and relative cleanliness.\\n\\n\"",

The Author(s).\\nSummary::\\nFrom visual perception to language, sensory stimuli change their meaning depending on previous experience. Recurrent neural dynamics can interpret stimuli based on externally cued context, but it is unknown whether they can compute and employ internal hypotheses to resolve ambiguities. Here we show that mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) can form several hypotheses over time and perform spatial reasoning through recurrent dynamics. In our task, mice navigated using ambiguous landmarks that are identified through their mutual spatial relationship, requiring sequential refinement of hypotheses. Neurons in RSC and in artificial neural networks encoded mixtures of hypotheses, location and sensory information, and were constrained by robust low-dimensional dynamics.

After exposure to a moving dot sequence, flashing a dot as a cue at the starting point of the sequence can elicit successive elevated responses even in the absence of the sequence. These cue-triggered elevated responses have been shown to play a crucial role in predicting future events in dynamic environments. However, temporal sequences we are exposed to typically contain rich feature information. It remains u\"",
