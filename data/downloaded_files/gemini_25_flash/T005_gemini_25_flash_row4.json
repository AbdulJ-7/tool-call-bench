Possible mechanisms include particulate irritation, inflammation from toxic insult, or legitimate adaptive immune-mediated response. Although sterile non-protein matter would not be expected to be immunogenic, one Apollo flight surgeon reported increasing symptoms upon repeated perceived exposure with associated eosinophilia, suggestive of possible allergic reactions. Many International Space Station (ISS) crews display a pattern of persistent immune system dysregulation and latent virus reactivation. Some ISS crews manifest atypical respiratory and/or dermatitis symptoms which could have an allergic component. It is logical to anticipate crew immune dysregulation could worsen during prolonged deep space missions and planetary surface hazards will only complicate crew health risks. Allergic (i.e. mast cell-mediated) reactivity could adversely increase negative clinical and operational impacts for long-duration lunar astronauts and affect countermeasure requirements for surface vehicles. This study investigated whether lunar dust exposure could possibly elicit an IgE mediated allergic response during spaceflight by utilizing in vitro cell culture models. Our laboratory was officially approved for receipt of actual lunar dust samples from the Apollo 16 mission from NASA. These samples were used to complete the proposed set of in vitro cell culture experiments, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy individuals, and basophils and eosinophil cell lines. Cells were co-cultured with cellular mitogens, common recall antigens (Der p1), fine ground silica qua\"",
